# StorefrontFrontend

This project is part of the Udacity Full-Stack Javascript Nanodegree

It is an E-Commerce plattform for buying cool stuff, build with Angular. It is currently only with mocked data and orders. In the future I will try to connect it with my backend so it is a fully functional platform. Also I will improve styling and user interaction. Currently this is just a small MVP with minimal funtionality and styling to pass the project requirements.

## Get started

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/marvin-splitt/storefront-frontend.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd storefront-frontend/
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

## Run development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
